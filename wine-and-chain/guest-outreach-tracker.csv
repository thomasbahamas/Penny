Wine and Chain - Guest Outreach Tracker
Target: Wine + Crypto Intersection | Season 1 (May-August 2025)

=== OUTREACH TEMPLATE ===
Subject: Guest Opportunity: Wine and Chain Podcast

Hi [Name],

I'm Torrey — I host Wine and Chain, a weekly podcast where my wife Jill (winemaker at Cambria Estate) and I explore the intersection of wine and crypto.

We go live every Wednesday at 3 PM PST, streaming from our vineyard. Jill teaches wine; I bring the crypto alpha. Our audience is growing fast at the exact intersection of wine tokenization, RWA, and blockchain.

We're booking guests for Season 1 (launching May 2025) and would love to have you on to discuss [specific topic].

The format is conversational — 15-20 minutes on camera, live or pre-recorded. We handle all the tech; you just bring your expertise.

Interested? Let's find a time that works.

Best,
Torrey
