## TRIP DEDUCTION BEST PRACTICES

### What Makes Expenses Defensible
1. **Document BEFORE the trip:** Email yourself the purpose, expected episodes
2. **Log DAILY:** What was filmed, who was interviewed, what was discussed
3. **Save EVERY receipt:** Photo immediately, upload to cloud
4. **Connect expenses to content:** "Mileage to Napa = Episode 7 winery visit"
5. **Keep receipts for 7 years:** IRS could audit

### Business vs. Personal
| Expense | Deductible | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Conference ticket | 100% | Business development |
| Hotel (business days) | 100% | Track business vs. personal days |
| Wine for episode | 100% | Production expense |
| Dinner with Jill (planning) | 50% | Business meal, document convo |
| Personal wine tasting | 0% | Not content-related |
