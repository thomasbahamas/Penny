## What's in the Glass
We're opening the 2019 Cambria Pinot Noir from Santa Maria Valley — a wine that perfectly represents what we do here at Wine and Chain. Jill explains why this Pinot is ideal for both wine newcomers and seasoned drinkers, and what makes Santa Maria Valley special for Pinot Noir.

**Tasting Notes:** Bright cherry, earthy mushroom undertones, silky tannins. Perfect with salmon or enjoyed on its own.

## This Week in Crypto
Torrey introduces the show's concept: every Wednesday, Jill teaches him about wine, and he teaches her about crypto. This week, he explains:
- Why crypto and wine aren't as different as you'd think
- The emerging world of RWA (Real World Assets) tokenization
- Why Solana is the chain to watch in 2025

## Key Takeaways
- Wine and crypto both reward patience — one ages, the other compounds
- Tokenization is coming to every asset class, including wine
- The best way to learn crypto (or wine) is with a glass in hand and a friend to explain it

## Resources Mentioned
- [Cambria Estate](https://cambriawines.com) — Jill's winery
- [SolanaFloor](https://solanafloor.com) — Torrey's crypto content
- [Understanding RWA Tokenization](link) — Further reading on real-world assets

## SEO TIPS FOR SHOW NOTES

### Title Format
`Episode [#]: [Catchy Title] — Wine and Chain`  
Example: `Episode 3: Tokenizing the Vineyard — Wine and Chain`

### First 150 Characters Matter
The first paragraph becomes the meta description. Make it compelling.

### Use Headers (H2, H3)
- Google loves structure
- Makes notes skimmable

### Include Timestamps (Optional but Good)
```
## Timestamps
- 0:00 — Intro + What's in the Glass
- 5:30 — Crypto Corner: RWA Tokenization
- 22:15 — Guest Interview with [Name]
- 45:00 — Outro + Next Week Preview
```

### Link to Previous Episodes
Build internal links — helps SEO and keeps listeners in your content.
