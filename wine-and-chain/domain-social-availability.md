# Wine and Chain — Domain & Social Handle Availability

## DOMAINS TO CHECK
*Use Namecheap, GoDaddy, or WHOIS lookup to verify*

| Domain | Priority | Status | Notes |
|--------|----------|--------|-------|
| wineandchain.com | HIGH | CHECK NEEDED | Ideal, but may be taken |
| wineandchain.xyz | HIGH | LIKELY AVAILABLE | Crypto-native, fits brand |
| wineandchain.io | HIGH | LIKELY AVAILABLE | Tech-forward, premium feel |
| wineandchain.fm | MEDIUM | CHECK NEEDED | Podcast-specific |
| wineandchain.show | MEDIUM | CHECK NEEDED | Modern podcast trend |
| drinkwineandchain.com | LOW | LIKELY AVAILABLE | Fallback option |
| thewineandchain.com | LOW | LIKELY AVAILABLE | Fallback option |

**Recommendation:** Check wineandchain.com first. If taken, wineandchain.xyz is probably your best bet for a crypto audience.

## LINKTREE / BIO LINK OPTIONS
*Pick one for "link in bio" across all platforms*

| Service | Cost | Pros | Cons |
|---------|------|------|------|
| Linktree | Free/Premium | Easy, recognized, analytics | Generic, limited customization |
| Beacons | Free/Premium | More design control | Less known |
| Carrd | $19/year | Full control, own domain | More setup |
| Custom on wineandchain.com | $0 | Brand control, SEO benefit | Requires website first |

**Recommendation:** Start with Linktree free, migrate to custom /links page on your domain once site is live.
