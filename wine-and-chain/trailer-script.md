## RECORDING NOTES

### Audio Tips
- Record in a quiet room (no HVAC noise, no echo)
- Use pop filters on mics
- Leave 2-3 seconds of silence at start/end for editing
- Record separately if possible (cleaner audio than Riverside together)

### Delivery Tips
- **Don't rush** — trailer feels longer when you're recording
- **Smile while talking** — it comes through in audio
- **Energy up 20%** — sounds flat when you play it back
- **Do 3 takes** — pick the best one

### Music Sourcing
- **Artlist** — $199/year, podcast license included
- **Epidemic Sound** — $15/month, great search filters
- **PremiumBeat** — per track, higher quality
- **Commission** — find a composer on Fiverr/Upwork ($100-300 for custom 60-sec track)

### Editing
- Use Descript — edit by deleting text
- Add music fade in/out (2-3 seconds)
- Normalize audio to -16 LUFS (podcast standard)
- Export: MP3, 128kbps, stereo
