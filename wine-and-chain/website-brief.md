# Wine and Chain Website Brief
## wineandchain.com — Phase 1 Launch

---

## STACK RECOMMENDATION

**My Pick: Framer (or Webflow)**

Given your 4-5 hour/week time constraint, here's why Framer > Next.js for v1:

| Framer | Next.js |
|--------|---------|
| Ship in 1 day | Ship in 1-2 weeks |
| No code needed | Requires dev time |
| Built-in CMS for episodes | Need to build CMS |
| Hosting included | Vercel + separate config |
| Easy updates (drag/drop) | Code changes required |
| $15-25/month | Free (but time costs) |

**Decision:** Start with Framer. When commerce gets complex (Solana Pay integration, token-gating), THEN migrate to Next.js with the revenue to justify the dev time.
