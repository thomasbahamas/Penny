# Capital Redeployment Analysis — $3,000 from BONK Exit

**Date:** February 19, 2026  
**Capital Available:** ~$3,000 USD  
**Source:** BONK position exit (previously 30% overweight)  
**Analyst:** Penny (overnight shift)

---

## Executive Summary

You exited BONK at the right time — avoiding further downside while freeing capital for better opportunities. This analysis presents 4 deployment strategies based on your goals.

**Quick Answer:**
- **If you want yield:** Ondo USY (4.3% APY, stable)
- **If you want SOL exposure:** JUP (liquidity hub) or JTO (Jito staking)
- **If you want safety:** Cash, wait for blood in the streets
- **If you want balanced:** 40% Ondo, 40% SOL ecosystem, 20% cash

---

## Option 1: RWA Yield Strategy (Conservative)

### Ondo USY — US Dollar Yield
- **APY:** ~4.3% (variable, backed by US Treasuries)
- **Risk:** Low (institutional-grade, regulated)
- **Liquidity:** High (24/7 on Solana)
- **Why now:** WisdomTree just launched on Solana — institutional validation

### Credix — Emerging Market Debt
- **APY:** 8-12% (higher risk, higher return)
- **Risk:** Medium (EM credit risk)
- **Why now:** Solana RWA narrative gaining steam

**Allocation suggestion:** $3,000 → 100% Ondo USY
**Expected yield:** ~$130/year passive income

**Best for:** Capital preservation with yield; waiting for better crypto entries

---

## Option 2: SOL Ecosystem Growth (Moderate Risk)

### Jupiter (JUP) — DEX Aggregator
- **Thesis:** Liquidity layer of Solana, fee switch coming
- **Current narrative:** Strong, dominates DEX volume
- **Risk:** Medium (governance token, volatile)
- **Catalyst:** Fee sharing implementation

### Jito (JTO) — Staking + MEV
- **Thesis:** Liquid staking + MEV revenue share
- **Current narrative:** JitoSOL becoming standard
- **Risk:** Medium (competition from Marinade, Lido)
- **Catalyst:** MEV revenue growth

### Pyth (PYTH) — Oracle Network
- **Thesis:** High-frequency oracle, institutional adoption
- **Current narrative:** Growing DAUs, chain expansion
- **Risk:** Medium-high (oracle competition is fierce)

**Allocation suggestion:**
- $1,500 JUP (50%)
- $1,000 JTO (33%)
- $500 PYTH (17%)

**Best for:** SOL ecosystem conviction; higher upside than RWA

---

## Option 3: Cash Reserve (Defensive)

### Stablecoins (USDC/USDT)
- **APY:** 0-5% (via Kamino, MarginFi, or Drift)
- **Risk:** Minimal (stablecoin risk only)
- **Optionality:** Maximum — ready to deploy on dips

### Why Cash Makes Sense Now
1. Market has been choppy
2. You just exited BONK (good timing)
3. SKRmaxing approval could change your liquidity needs
4. "Be fearful when others are greedy, greedy when others are fearful"

**Allocation suggestion:** $3,000 → 100% USDC, earn 3-5% on Kamino

**Best for:** Maximum flexibility; waiting for obvious opportunity

---

## Option 4: Barbell Strategy (Balanced)

Split between safety and upside:

| Allocation | Asset | Amount | Rationale |
|------------|-------|--------|-----------|
| 40% | Ondo USY | $1,200 | Yield base, stable |
| 30% | JUP | $900 | SOL ecosystem exposure |
| 20% | JTO | $600 | Staking + MEV play |
| 10% | Cash (USDC) | $300 | Dry powder for dips |

**Expected outcome:**
- Downside protection via USY yield
- Upside participation via SOL ecosystem
- Flexibility via cash reserve

**Best for:** You don't have strong conviction either way

---

## Market Context

### What's Happening
- **RWA narrative:** Hot right now (Matrixdock, WisdomTree, Ondo)
- **SOL price:** Trading in range, no clear breakout
- **Meme coins:** Cooling off after BONK/PEPE mania
- **Macro:** Rates still elevated, crypto correlation to tech stocks

### What Could Change
- **SKRmaxing approval:** Could generate SOL demand (you'll need liquidity for launch costs)
- **Fed pivot:** Would boost risk assets broadly
- **Solana institutional adoption:** Continues to accelerate

---

## My Recommendation

**For your specific situation:**

Given that:
1. You run a Solana media business (SolanaFloor)
2. You have SKRmaxing pending approval
3. You just reduced risk (exited BONK)
4. You have family obligations (capital preservation matters)

**Suggested allocation:**

| Asset | Amount | % |
|-------|--------|---|
| Ondo USY | $1,500 | 50% |
| JUP | $900 | 30% |
| Cash (USDC) | $600 | 20% |

**Rationale:**
- **USY (50%):** Yield while you wait; institutional-grade safety
- **JUP (30%):** Direct exposure to Solana DEX volume; aligns with your content business
- **Cash (20%):** Flexibility for SKRmaxing launch costs or market dip buying

This gives you:
- ✅ ~$65/year passive yield on the USY portion
- ✅ SOL ecosystem upside via JUP
- ✅ Liquidity for opportunities
- ✅ Downside protection

## Execution Notes

### If you choose Ondo USY
1. Visit app.ondo.finance
2. Connect wallet (Phantom/Solflare)
3. Mint USY with USDC
4. APY accrues automatically

### If you choose JUP/JTO
1. Use Jupiter to swap USDC → JUP/JTO
2. Consider staking JTO for additional yield
3. JUP has no staking yet (fee switch pending)

### If you choose Cash Reserve
1. Deposit USDC on Kamino (kamino.finance)
2. Current APY: ~3-5%
3. Instant withdrawal when needed

## Tax Considerations

**BONK exit:** You exited BONK — this is a taxable event.
- If you had gains: You'll owe capital gains tax
- If you had losses: You can harvest losses

**Re-deployment:** Swapping between assets triggers more taxable events.

**Consider:** Talk to your accountant about:
- Wash sale rules (if applicable to crypto in your jurisdiction)
- Whether to hold new positions >1 year for long-term treatment
- If any of this is in a tax-advantaged account

## Monitoring Plan

After deployment, track these metrics monthly:

| Asset | Metric to Watch | Alert Threshold |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Ondo USY | APY change | Drop below 3% |
| JUP | DEX volume share | Drop below 50% |
| JTO | JitoSOL dominance | Major competitor launch |
| Cash | Opportunity cost | Market dip >20% |

---

## Final Thoughts

You made a smart move exiting BONK. The 30% overweight was risky, and you took profits (or cut losses) at the right time.

**The question now:** Do you redeploy immediately or wait?

**My take:** There's no urgent catalyst forcing deployment. The RWA yield strategy (Option 1 or 4) lets you earn while you wait for obvious opportunities.

**The danger:** Sitting in cash too long and missing the next leg up.

**The compromise:** The barbell approach (50% yield, 30% growth, 20% cash) gives you the best of all worlds.
