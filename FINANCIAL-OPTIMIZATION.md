# Financial Optimization Strategy

## Current Situation
- Heavy BONK position (needs rebalancing)
- Single income stream (SolanaFloor content)
- SKRmaxing = potential new revenue source

## Overnight Focus Areas

### 1. BONK Position Management
**What I track:**
- Daily price action + RSI
- Portfolio concentration alerts (>30% = warning)
- Rebalance simulations (how much to trim, where to move)

**Morning deliverable:**
"BONK is X% of portfolio. RSI is Y. If you trim Z%, you free up $A for alternatives."

### 2. RWA Opportunity Scanning
**What I research:**
- New tokenized treasury products on Solana
- Yield rates (Ondo, Maple, Credix)
- Risk ratings + lockup periods

**Morning deliverable:**
"3 RWA options: Ondo (4.2%, low risk), Credix (12%, med risk), Homebase (8%, illiquid)"

### 3. New Income Stream Discovery
**What I investigate:**
- Solana grants and hackathons (apply while building)
- Sponsorship opportunities for SolanaFloor
- Premium content models (paid newsletter, Patreon)
- Consulting opportunities in Solana ecosystem

**Morning deliverable:**
"2 grant opportunities closing this week. 1 potential sponsor reaching out to competitors."

### 4. Cost Optimization
**What I analyze:**
- API spend across all tools
- Hosting costs (can we optimize?)
- Time allocation (what's eating hours with low ROI?)
