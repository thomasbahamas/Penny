**Previous:** HTTP 406 (Not Acceptable) on Feb 11-13
**Progress:** Error changed from 406 → 500 (server responding but failing)

**Likely Cause:** Server-side crash or database connection issue
**Action Needed:** Check server logs for stack traces

## 💰 Solana Market Brief

### SOL Price Action
- **Price:** $84.82 (+8.3% 24h | -41.3% 30d)
- **Position in 30D Range:** 13% (near range lows)
- **From ATH:** -71.1% ($293 → $84)
- **Mcap/FDV:** 0.92 (healthy, low inflation risk)

**Penny's Take:** SOL bouncing at range lows. Good DCA zone if you're accumulating. Major support around $75 (30D low).

### Portfolio Notes
- BONK exposure still needs rebalancing (check simulator in /projects/)
- RWA yields on Solana looking attractive (Ondo ~4%, Credix ~12%)
