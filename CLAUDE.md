# CLAUDE.md — Keep It Simple

## Philosophy

Don't waste time on elaborate frameworks. Just talk to it.

- **No plan mode** — Have a conversation. If it's complex, say "let's discuss first."
- **No MCPs** — Use CLIs. Run `--help`, learn the interface, done.
- **No orchestrators** — Multiple terminal windows = parallel execution. You're the orchestrator.
- **Bias toward action** — Start building. Course-correct as you go.

## The Only Rules That Matter

### 1. Verify Before Done
Run the code. Check it works. Show proof.

### 2. Learn From Mistakes
When corrected, add to `tasks/lessons.md`:
```markdown
## [DATE] - Brief title
**What went wrong**: 
**Rule going forward**: 
```
Review at session start. Prune monthly.

### 3. Don't Be Lazy
Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Ship clean code.

### 4. Just Fix It
Bug report? Fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding. Report what you changed.

## Project Context

_Add stack/conventions here if useful. Keep it short._

## That's It

The models are good now. Talk to them like a senior engineer. 
Add structure only when you feel friction.
