## Major Events

### BONK Position Exit
- Thomas sold entire BONK position (was 30% of portfolio, ~$3,000)
- Previously flagged as overweight risk
- Capital now available for redeployment

### LifeOS PWA Development
- Fixed bottom navigation button touch targets for mobile
- Added real data display (removed "Loading..." placeholders)
- Shows portfolio data, family calendar, agent status
- Server instability issues - Cloudflare tunnels expire ~24 hours
- Need permanent domain (life.thomasbahamas.com) for stability

### LLM Fallback Strategy
- Kimi K2.5 credits depleted
- Built multi-provider fallback chain:
  1. Kimi K2.5 (primary, when available)
  2. Gemini Flash ($0.10/M - cheapest)
  3. GPT-4o-mini ($0.15/M)
  4. Claude Sonnet 4.6 ($3/M)
  5. Grok-2 ($2/M)
- Thomas has subscriptions: Claude, Grok, OpenAI, Gemini
- Need to configure API keys for direct access

### Content Pipeline
- Hyperliquid vs Solana Perps script drafted and saved
- Scheduled for Wednesday review with Sheldon
- Strong narrative: Hyperliquid flywheel vs Drift mistakes vs Solana counterattack

### Family Calendar
- Daycare closures tracked: Easter (Apr 2-6), Memorial Day (May 25)
- Anniversary trip: Newport Beach May 4-8
- Automated 2-week advance notifications via cron

### OpenClaw Status
- Currently on 2026.2.9
- Update to 2026.2.15 pending
- Config validation issue with ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env var

## Technical Debt
- LifeOS needs permanent hosting (not Cloudflare tunnels)
- Qdrant memory still not installed (pip3 install qdrant-client)
- Notion integration token needs secure setup
- Google Calendar API for family sync (manual for now)

## Next Actions
- Deploy LifeOS to life.thomasbahamas.com
- Complete OpenClaw update to 2026.2.15
- Set up LLM fallback API keys
- Research BONK capital redeployment options
