## Context Retention System (In Progress)
- Building 4-component memory system inspired by Eric's architecture
- Components: Hourly summarizer, Post-compaction injector, Vector memory (FAISS), Semantic recall hook
- Started dependency install (python3-pip, FAISS, sentence-transformers)
- Hit context overflow during build - switched to Kimi K2.5
- Need to resume: finish deps, build hourly-memory-summarizer.py

## Solana SKILL.md Added
- Pulled official Solana development guidelines from solana.com/SKILL.md
- Now follows framework-kit-first approach (@solana/client + @solana/react-hooks)
- Uses @solana/kit for SDK, @solana/web3-compat for legacy
- Committed to /skills/solana/SKILL.md

## Daily Briefing Fixed
- Cron wasn't sending to Telegram (401 Unauthorized)
- Fixed by adding TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID to cron environment
- Test briefing sent successfully
- Should resume 5:30 AM PST tomorrow

## Meme Coin Group Chat Concept
- User wants group with friends + multiple agents analyzing meme coins
- Architecture: Telegram group, Penny + other agents, auto-analyze mentions
- Trigger options: Natural mentions, /commands, auto-scan contract addresses
- Proactive alerts on high-volume/pattern detection
- Multi-agent debate mode possible

## OpenClaw 2026.2.9 Update
- Updated to latest version
- Includes: Grok web search, fixed amnesia bug, context overflow recovery, cron reliability
- Attempted to add Grok but hit config errors (need to fix model schema)

## Projects in Flight
1. Context Retention System - need to complete Python deps and scripts
2. SKRMaxi website (skrmaxi.com) - SSL/router issues, needs content
3. Meme coin group chat - needs implementation
4. Grok integration - needs proper config
