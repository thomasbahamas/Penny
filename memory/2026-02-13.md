# Memory Log — Friday, February 13, 2026

## Overnight Work Summary

### Research Completed
- **Solana Ecosystem:** Major RWA developments (Matrixdock, WisdomTree, Ondo)
- **x402 Protocol:** Fetched live stats — 75M+ transactions, strong traction
- **SKRmaxi Status:** Still down with 406 errors — needs Thomas attention

### Deliverables Created
1. Morning Brief (Feb 13) — comprehensive briefing with priorities
2. Content angles — 3 fresh video ideas from overnight research
3. Portfolio simulator — ready for BONK rebalancing scenarios

### Blockers Identified
- SKRmaxi site down 48+ hours (406 errors)
- Brave API key missing — limits web search capability
- Birdeye API key needed for wallet analysis automation

## Key Learnings

### Content Opportunities
- RWA narrative is HOT — institutions choosing Solana
- x402 has real traction (75M txs) — good for "future of internet" angle
- "Dat Capitulation" is evergreen — market always has fear/greed cycles

### Technical Debt
- SKRmaxi monitoring working but site is broken (not the monitor)
- Need to fix Accept header issues in monitor or fix server config
- Morning briefing system functional and ready for daily use

## Action Items for Thomas
1. Fix SKRmaxi (Cloudflare/config issue)
2. Greenlight video production (3 outlines ready)
3. Decision: Birdeye API key worth it?
4. Decision: Archive Wine & Chain?

## Notes
- Portfolio simulator saved to `/root/clawd/projects/portfolio_simulator.py`
- Content outlines updated with fresh research
- x402 stats will make compelling video content
