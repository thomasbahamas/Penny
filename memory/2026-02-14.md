### Content Research: RWA Institutional Migration
**Source:** solana.com/news direct fetch

New RWA launches on Solana in Jan-Feb 2026:
1. **Matrixdock XAUm** (Feb 10) — Asia's largest tokenized gold
2. **WisdomTree** (Jan 28) — Full regulated fund suite
3. **Ondo Global Markets** (Jan 21) — 200+ tokenized stocks/ETFs
4. **Fireblocks** (Jan 20) — Enterprise treasury infrastructure

**Key insight:** Wall Street is choosing Solana for RWA over Ethereum. Speed, cost, reliability cited.

### Project Status Updates

- ✅ SUBMITTED to dApp Store (Feb 13)
- Status: Awaiting review (3-5 days)
- No action required

#### SKRmaxi Website
- 🔴 Still down (HTTP 500, changed from 406)
- Likely server crash or DB issue
- Needs log review when Thomas has bandwidth

#### Crypto Memo Tool
- 🟡 Functional (CoinGecko)
- Tested with SOL data fetch
- Birdeye API still missing (optional)

## Key Decisions Pending

1. **Video production:** 3 outlines ready (Dat Capitulation, x402, RWA Takeover)
2. **Birdeye API:** Get key for on-chain data? ($0-100/mo)
3. **Price alerts:** Scope definition needed
4. **SKRmaxi:** Fix server when ready (not urgent)

## Notes for Future Reference
