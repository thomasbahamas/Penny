# Hyperliquid vs Solana Perps - Draft Script

**Working Title:** "Hyperliquid Won Perps. Can Solana Take Them Back?"

## COLD OPEN — The uncomfortable truth

Solana is supposed to be the home of trading. And yet, flows into Hyperliquid came mostly from Solana users in 2025.

Solana's own traders left for a competitor built on Arbitrum.

How did this happen?

## ACT 1 — HOW HYPERLIQUID WON: THE FLYWHEEL

Break down Hyperliquid's flywheel — each piece feeding the next:

### 1. Purpose-built tech
- Custom L1, sub-second finality
- 200k orders/sec
- Fully onchain orderbook

Bullet's Tristan Frizza acknowledged that perps are the most complex DeFi use case, requiring high performance and low latency that's hard to achieve on a general-purpose chain with 2,000 validators.

### 2. No VCs = maximum community allocation
- 31% of HYPE was airdropped (typical: 5-15%)
- Zero private investor allocations

This was radical. While other projects gave 20%+ to VCs and crumbs to users, Hyperliquid flipped the script.

### 3. Made the community rich
- 94,000 users eligible
- Average allocation: ~$45,000
- HYPE launched at $4 and kept climbing

People didn't dump. They became believers.

### 4. Revenue-backed tokenomics
- 2025: ~$600M protocol revenue
- Majority: HYPE buybacks and burns

This isn't vapor — it's a real business funding its own token's value.

### 5. Institutional recognition
- 21Shares filed Hyperliquid product with U.S. SEC
- Regulated HYPE ETP on Swiss stock exchange

**The Flywheel:**
Great product → generous airdrop → community gets rich → community becomes evangelists → more users → more volume → more revenue → buybacks + burns → price goes up → repeat.

## ACT 2 — THE DRIFT CAUTIONARY TALE

Before Hyperliquid, Drift was supposed to be Solana's perps answer. Everyone shilled it. VCs loved it. Solana founders backed it.

**But here's what actually happened in the bear market:**

- Couldn't reliably place market orders
- 10% stop loss triggered immediately on entry
- Breaking even felt like a win
- DRIFT airdrop: sold instantly — no community attachment

**The lesson:** Drift had institutional support, VC backing, ecosystem cheerleading. But none of that matters if the product betrays users. Every failed fill, every phantom liquidation eroded trust. And trust is the one thing you can't buy back with points programs.

Meanwhile, Hyperliquid quietly did the opposite — building something that actually worked, with zero marketing spend, letting the product speak.

## ACT 3 — SOLANA'S COUNTERATTACK

Now Solana's builders are taking the problem seriously:

### Bullet (ex-Zeta Markets)
- App-specific L2 rollup
- 1.2ms median execution latency (vs Hyperliquid's 70ms)
- Pure Rust stack
- ZEX token migrates 1:1 to BULLET
- Gated mainnet live

Tristan shut down Zeta ($10B+ annual volume) to build from scratch. That's conviction.

### Jito's BAM (Block Assembly Marketplace)
- Custom sequencing logic via plugins
- Taker speed bumps (crucial to Hyperliquid's success)
- Live on mainnet (September 2025)

This is Solana's block-building layer getting a complete redesign.

### Others
- **Bulk:** $8M seed, perps sidecar approach
- **Flash Trade:** "Magic blocks" via MagicBlock's ephemeral rollups
- **Alpenglow:** Next-gen consensus for lower latency

## ACT 4 — THE REAL GAP ISN'T TECH, IT'S COMMUNITY

Even if Bullet matches Hyperliquid on latency... so what?

Hyperliquid's moat isn't just speed. It's that they created a tribe of wealthy, loyal traders who identify with the platform.

**Solana's perps challenger needs to figure out:**

### Tokenomics
- ZEX already exists as a "failing" token from Zeta's era
- 1:1 ZEX → BULLET migration is smart
- But does it create the same wealth-creation moment HYPE did?

### Community wealth creation
- Hyperliquid made 94,000 people feel like founders
- Solana perps needs its own genesis moment
- Massive airdrop to Solana power users? Something new?

### The founder factor
- Hyperliquid's Jeff Yan: cult figure
- Tristan Frizza: respected in Solana
- Can he attract tradfi/degen crossover crowd?

### Identity
- Hyperliquid users: "Hyperliquid maxi" community — it's a culture
- Solana perps needs identity beyond "we're on Solana"

---

## ACT 5 — THE BULL CASE FOR SOLANA

Solana isn't dead in this fight:

### Bullet's product might genuinely be better
- 1.2ms vs 70ms is a massive gap
- If UX matches, serious traders will notice

### Composability matters
- Perps venue living in Solana ecosystem can tap into all of DeFi
- Lending, LSTs as collateral — ways Hyperliquid can't easily replicate

### BAM changes the game at infrastructure level
- Drift, Jupiter perps, others can leverage custom sequencing
- Whole ecosystem levels up

### Solana's existing user base is massive
- Traders are already there
- They just need a reason to come home

### Real volume exists
- Solana-based perpetual contracts: $451.2B annual volume
- Activity is real, just fragmented

## CLOSING — Different product, same war

Your instinct is right: Solana's answer probably won't be a Hyperliquid clone. It'll be something different — a perps product deeply integrated with Solana DeFi, where LST collateral earns yield while you trade, where composability is the killer feature Hyperliquid can't match because it's an island.

But the flywheel lesson remains: you have to get the product right first, then create a wealth-creation event that turns users into believers. Drift tried to skip ahead and the community never materialized.

Whoever solves this for Solana needs to learn from both Hyperliquid's wins and Drift's mistakes.
