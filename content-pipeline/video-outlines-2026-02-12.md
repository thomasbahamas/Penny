# 📹 Video Script Outlines — Ready for Review

## 1. Thomas Cowan Short (SolanaFloor)

### Working Title Options:
- "The Doctor Who Saw Through the System (And Found Crypto)"
- "Medical Freedom Meets Financial Freedom"
- "Why This Doctor Thinks Decentralization Matters"

### Angle Research Needed:
- Does Cowan have a position on crypto/blockchain?

### Suggested Structure (3-5 min):
1. **Hook** (0:00-0:15): Clip of Cowan saying something controversial about control/censorship
2. **The Parallel** (0:15-1:00): Medical censorship → Financial censorship
3. **Why Solana?** (1:00-2:30): Fast, cheap, censorship-resistant transactions
4. **The Takeaway** (2:30-3:00): Decentralization protects freedom (medical + financial)

### Open Questions:
- [ ] Has Cowan actually mentioned crypto? (Need to verify)
- [ ] Do you want to interview him or just comment on his ideas?
- [ ] Tone: Supportive, neutral, or critical?
