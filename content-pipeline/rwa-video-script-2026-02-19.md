## SCRIPT

### [0:00-0:20] HOOK

**[VISUAL: Fast cuts — Wall Street sign, gold bars, Solana logo, Matrixdock announcement]**

**THOMAS (to camera):**

"The biggest financial migration in history is happening right now.

Three of the largest asset managers in the world just moved their tokenized products to Solana.

Not Ethereum. Not Polygon. Solana.

And almost nobody in crypto is talking about it."

**[CUT TO: Title card — "Wall Street Is Moving to Solana"]**

---

### [0:20-1:30] THE EVIDENCE — MATRIXDOCK

**[VISUAL: Matrixdock logo, XAUm token graphic, gold bars animation]**

**THOMAS:**

"Let's start with Matrixdock. February 10th — they announced XAUm, Asia's largest tokenized gold product, is now live on Solana.

We're talking about institutional-grade gold. Same-day settlement. DeFi integration.

This isn't some crypto-native experiment. This is real gold, tokenized, on Solana."

**[TEXT OVERLAY: "Matrixdock XAUm — $100M+ AUM"]**

**THOMAS:**

"Why does this matter? Because gold is a $13 trillion market. And the infrastructure to trade it just got significantly better on Solana than on any other chain."

---

### [1:30-2:30] THE EVIDENCE — WISDOMTREE + ONDO

**[VISUAL: Split screen — WisdomTree logo + Ondo logo. Quick cuts of their product interfaces]**

**THOMAS:**

"But Matrixdock wasn't alone.

January 28th — WisdomTree, the $80 billion asset manager, brought their full suite of regulated tokenized funds to Solana. Money market funds, equities, fixed income — all on-chain.

And January 21st — Ondo Global Markets launched with over 200 tokenized U.S. stocks and ETFs. Two hundred. Making them the largest real-world asset issuer on Solana."

**[TEXT OVERLAY: Timeline graphic]
- Jan 21: Ondo (200+ stocks)
- Jan 28: WisdomTree (full suite)
- Feb 10: Matrixdock (gold)**

**THOMAS:**

"Three major launches. Three weeks. All chose Solana over Ethereum."

---

### [2:30-3:30] WHY SOLANA?

**[VISUAL: Solana tech stack animation — throughput numbers, cost comparison, Fireblocks integration]**

**THOMAS:**

"So why Solana? Why not Ethereum, where all the DeFi liquidity supposedly lives?

Three reasons.

**First — speed.** Solana settles in 400 milliseconds. Ethereum takes 12 seconds on a good day. When you're moving millions of dollars, that 30x speed difference matters.

**Second — cost.** Solana transactions cost fractions of a penny. On Ethereum, you're paying dollars per transaction, sometimes tens of dollars during congestion. For institutional-sized trades, that's unacceptable.

**Third — infrastructure.** Fireblocks — the treasury infrastructure used by 1,800+ institutions — is fully integrated with Solana. This means enterprise security with internet speed."

**[TEXT OVERLAY: Comparison chart]
| | Solana | Ethereum |
| Settlement | 400ms | 12s |
| Cost | $0.00025 | $1-50 |
| Fireblocks | ✅ | ❌ |**

---

### [3:30-4:30] WHAT THIS MEANS FOR RETAIL

**[VISUAL: Phone screen showing tokenized assets, portfolio app, user journey]**

**THOMAS:**

"Here's why you should care.

Before this, if you wanted to buy gold, you had to call a broker, fill out paperwork, wait for settlement, pay custody fees.

Now? You buy XAUm on Solana with your Phantom wallet. Settles in seconds. Costs pennies. You hold the keys.

Same for stocks. Ondo gives you access to Apple, Tesla, SPY — all tokenized, all tradable 24/7, all in your self-custodied wallet.

This is the financial system being rebuilt on better infrastructure."

**[TEXT OVERLAY: "24/7 Trading • Instant Settlement • Self Custody"]**

---

### [4:30-5:30] THE PLAYBOOK

**[VISUAL: Portfolio allocation pie chart, token tickers, risk spectrum]**

**THOMAS:**

"So how do you position for this?

**Option one — the tokens.** Ondo, if you believe in the RWA infrastructure play. Solana itself, as the settlement layer capturing all this value.

**Option two — the products.** Just use them. Buy tokenized gold instead of paper gold. Buy tokenized stocks instead of Robinhood. Vote with your capital.

**Option three — both.** That's what I'm doing."

**[TEXT OVERLAY: "Not financial advice — DYOR"]**

---

### [5:30-6:00] CLOSE

**[VISUAL: Back to Thomas, confident, slightly urgent]**

**THOMAS:**

"The narrative window on this is closing fast. In two weeks, everyone will be talking about RWA on Solana. But right now? You're early.

Three weeks ago, none of this existed. Today, you have institutional gold, regulated funds, and 200+ stocks — all on Solana.

Wall Street is moving here. The question is whether you'll be early or late.

Like and subscribe for more Solana alpha. I'll see you in the next one."
