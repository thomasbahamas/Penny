# 🚨 SKRmaxi Incident Report — Feb 12, 2026

## Summary
All SKRmaxi endpoints have been returning HTTP 406 errors for 24+ hours. Site is effectively down.

## Timeline
- **First detected failure:** 2026-02-11 13:35 UTC
- **Duration:** 24+ hours continuous
- **Last check:** 2026-02-11 20:45 UTC (still failing)

## Affected Endpoints
| Endpoint | Status | Response Time | Error |
|----------|--------|---------------|-------|
| /health | DOWN | 190-1100ms | HTTP 406 |
| /stats | DOWN | 184-485ms | HTTP 406 |
| /recent_users | DOWN | 187-408ms | HTTP 406 |
| /homepage | DOWN | 187-417ms | HTTP 406 |

## What is HTTP 406?
**406 Not Acceptable** = Server cannot produce a response matching the request's Accept headers.

Common causes:
1. **Content negotiation failure** — Client requests JSON, server only serves HTML (or vice versa)
2. **Reverse proxy misconfiguration** — Cloudflare/nginx blocking based on headers
3. **Missing API version header** — Server expects version, client doesn't send it
4. **Bot protection** — WAF blocking automated requests

## Diagnostic Steps to Take

### 1. Check Server Logs
```bash
# On SKRmaxi server
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
sudo tail -f /var/log/app/skrmaxi.log
```

### 2. Test with curl (different headers)
```bash
# Test basic
curl -I https://skrmaxi.com/health

# Test with explicit Accept
curl -H "Accept: application/json" https://skrmaxi.com/health
curl -H "Accept: text/html" https://skrmaxi.com/health

# Test without any special headers
curl -A "Mozilla/5.0" https://skrmaxi.com/health
```

### 3. Check Recent Deployments
- Did you push changes in the last 48 hours?
- Any config changes (env vars, nginx, Cloudflare)?
- Database migrations that might affect responses?

### 4. Check Cloudflare/WAF
- Any new firewall rules?
- Rate limiting triggered?
- Bot fight mode too aggressive?

## Immediate Actions
- [ ] Verify site in browser (is it just the API or the whole site?)
- [ ] Check deployment logs for recent changes
- [ ] Test curl commands above
- [ ] Review Cloudflare security events

## Monitor Script Note
The current monitor at `/root/clawd/mission-control/skrmaxi_monitor.jsonl` is working correctly — it's accurately detecting the outage. The issue is with SKRmaxi itself, not the monitoring.
