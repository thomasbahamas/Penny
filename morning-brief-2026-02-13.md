# 🌅 Morning Brief — Friday, February 13, 2026

## 🚨 SKRmaxi Status: STILL DOWN

**Status:** All endpoints returning HTTP 406 (Not Acceptable)  
**Duration:** 48+ hours continuous failures  
**Impact:** Site completely inaccessible  

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- 406 = "Not Acceptable" - typically a content negotiation issue
- Cloudflare or reverse proxy rejecting requests due to Accept header mismatch
- Server expecting specific headers that monitor isn't sending

**ACTION REQUIRED:** This needs your attention today. Potential fixes:
1. Check Cloudflare firewall rules
2. Verify server Accept header requirements
3. Review recent deployments that may have changed request handling
