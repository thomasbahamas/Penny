## 🚨 URGENT: SKRmaxi Down

**Status:** All endpoints returning HTTP 406 (Not Acceptable)  
**Duration:** At least 24+ hours (logs show continuous failures since Feb 11 13:35 UTC)  
**Affected:** /health, /stats, /recent_users, /homepage  

**Likely Causes:**
- Cloudflare or reverse proxy blocking requests (406 often = Accept header mismatch)
- Server-side content negotiation issue
- Deployment/config change that broke request handling

**Action Required:** Check server logs, verify Accept headers in requests, review recent deployments.
